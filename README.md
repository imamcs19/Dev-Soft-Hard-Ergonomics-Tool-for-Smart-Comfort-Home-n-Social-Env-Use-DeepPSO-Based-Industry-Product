# Dev-Soft-Hard-Ergonomics-Tool-for-Smart-Comfort-Home-n-Social-Env-Use-DeepPSO-Based-Industry-Product

The process of striving comfort on the physical and mental conditions, and home environment as well as job is the main target in achieving social ergonomics which also has positive effects on non-social ergonomics. In the social field, indubitably, there are many events that cause noise, making additional activities that can actually be trimmed or simplified to be easier and more resilient, that is, not to interfere with work activities in the office, not to disturb the environment, especially neighbors and even family at home, for example, in the form of certain activities that cause noise and others so that time becomes quite wasteful and less productive (losing so much time). In this study, two kinds of product formulation designs are proposed for the optimization of ergonomic ratings for home comfort and social environment by using a composition quantity within a certain value interval using Deep Particle Swarm Optimization (Deep PSO) Algorithm. The first tool is in the form of “soft product ergonomics” and the second is “hard product ergonomics”. From the results of optimization and information system technology from making the prototype design, it is considered capable of being a measurable solution to provide comfort recommendations to all parties, including individuals and community groups in houses, offices and social life in their environment.

Keywords: ergonomics tool prototype, home and social environment, comfort and safety of house and environment, noise sound reduction, deep pso
